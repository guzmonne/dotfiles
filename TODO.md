### Notion API script to create notes from the console.

The idea would be to be able to open a new `tmux` window with vim open. Create the note, and then
save it to Notion using its API. Maybe it can be written as a `vim` plugin. Maybe it already exist.
I don't know. Why are you still here? Go find out...

Edit [18/11/2021 10:58]: This is the second time I come here to write this TODO. I've written a script
that can create a new `note` on a Notion database in my account called `ShellDB`. The only problem is
that I have to leave the console and edit the `note` in notion itself. It would be nice if instead
`vim` would open to a new file where I could write the test, and then once I save it, it gets converted
into a full entry inside the same database.
