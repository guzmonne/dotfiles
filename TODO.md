### Notion API script to create notes from the console.

The idea would be to be able to open a new `tmux` window with vim open. Create the note, and then
save it to Notion using its API. Maybe it can be written as a `vim` plugin. Maybe it already exist.
I don't know. Why are you still here? Go find out...
